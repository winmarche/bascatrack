# Bascatrack - Basic Call Tracker

Description
-----------
Bascatrack (BASic CAll TRACKer) is a tracker an agent in a contact  
centre can use to track their stats for the day. It can show if they  
have met their KPIs for keeping their calls under the duration given  
for their centre in that day. Agents can enter the percentage of calls  
they should target, that must stay under a specific duration so the page  
can show if they have met it or not.
